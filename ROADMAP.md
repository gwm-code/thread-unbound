## 📝 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Data Persistence Strategy
- **LocalStorage:** Player progress, unlocks, currency, purchases
- **Cloud Save (Optional):** Cross-device sync, leaderboards
- **Session Storage:** Temporary state, daily challenge progress

### State Management Considerations
- Consider Context API or Redux for complex state (shop, achievements, stats)
- Keep game state in App.tsx as currently structured
- Separate state for meta-progression features

### Component Architecture
- New components needed:
  - `StartMenu.tsx` - Main menu navigation
  - `Shop.tsx` - Shop interface with tabs
  - `Achievements.tsx` - Achievement grid display
  - `Leaderboard.tsx` - Leaderboard tables
  - `DailyChallenge.tsx` - Challenge tracker
  - `Profile.tsx` - Stats and profile display
  - `GameExplanation.tsx` - Tutorial/help reference

### Performance Considerations
- Lazy load cosmetics/assets
- Optimize particle effects (limit count, pool instances)
- Debounce currency updates
- Cache leaderboard data
